                <p>A construction company is a business, corporation, or similar organization established to construct various structures, facility developments, property, housing, sidewalks, roads, highways, and other construction projects. In working on a project, a construction company needs to be prepared for many activities.</p>
                <p>Construction industry contains many elements which yield high carbon footprint such as cement and aggregates production and transportation. Cement has one of the largest shares in generating carbon footprint with a production of 7% of world total CO2 emission: China is the biggest producer of cement, followed by India with nearly 2350 million metric tons (Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018). Sustainability in the construction industry is inevitable and this not only means that it must reduce carbon footprint and save the environment, but it should also contribute to conserve the natural resources which are fundamental for continuous growth (Kisku et al., 2017; Akhtar and Sarmah, 2018; Behera et al., 2014).Aggregate plays a very crucial role in concrete occupying around 60%-75% of its total volume.</p>
                <p>The extensive increase in the rate of industrialization and urbanization due to the parallel growth in economy and population has made the use of concrete as the most non-sustainable material consuming the maximum amount of natural resources. Indeed, concrete uses approximately 20 billion tons of raw materials (coarse aggregate) each year. With the increase in rate of consumption, it is expected that the demand of aggregates will be doubled in the next two to three decades.</p>

            <p>To say that this 3 month modernization was a Herculean task would be an understatement. I remain convinced at this time, 2 weeks prior to occupancy that no other construction firm in the Bay Area could have handled such a task and pulled it off successfully. I have become fond of calling Alten the “Dream House Team” of construction and would recommend them without qualification.</p>
